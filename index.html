<h2>Domains</h2>
<p>We provide a domain purchasing service that seamlessly integrates with the W3Schools web hosting and development platform ("Spaces"). It allows you to search, select, and purchase a domain that automatically links to your Spaces.</p>
<p>When you buy a domain, you become its sole owner and must follow all related terms and conditions.</p>
<p>W3Schools works with third-party providers, such as Amazon and its Route 53 services, for domain registration and distribution. You can review their terms here:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/domain-registration-agreement/" target="_blank">Amazon Route 53 Domain Registration Agreement</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/amazon-registrar-policies/" target="_blank">Amazon Registrar Policy Page</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gandi.net/en/contracts/terms-of-service" target="_blank">Gandi Contract Page</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As the distributor, W3Schools handles purchasing and billing. If you have any complaints, claims, or concerns about these third-party products, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@w3schools.com">support@w3schools.com</a>.</p>
<p>The mutual agreement for a domain renews automatically each year. If you don't want to continue with a domain purchase from us, you must cancel the renewal before the end of the current agreement. See the <a href="#billing_and_account_information">Billing and Account Information</a> section for more billing information.</p>
<p>We are not liable for any harm, errors, or omissions caused by the domain registry administrator's actions, including domain registration or renewal requests. Before purchasing a domain, please review all associated third-party policies and practices to ensure you understand their terms.</p>
